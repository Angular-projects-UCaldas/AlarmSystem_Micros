# The objective of this project is to develop an alarm system using an Arduino ESP32-CAM:

1. Detects motion through a Pir Hc-sr501 motion sensor.
2. It emits an alarm in the place where it is installed.
3. Takes a photo to be sent with the alert to the registered number.
4. Sends an alert via WhatsApp.
5. Once the user receives the alert, he/she can deactivate the alarm remotely by replying to the message sent via WhatsApp.
